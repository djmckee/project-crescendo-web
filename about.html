                <p>
                    Sonata is an Android app designed to teach you how to compose
                    music through a simple and easy to use musical
                    programming interface - no sheet music knowledge
                    required!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sonata includes a range of step-by-step interactive
                    tutorials, guiding the user through how to use the
                    application and then how to write their own compositions.
                    Compositions can be converted into sheet music, or
                    played back as sound. They can also be exported as an
                    industry standard MusicXML file, which can be uploaded
                    to our hosted API, and shared via social media including
                    Facebook &amp; Twitter

                <h1>Who created Sonata?</h1>
                <p>
                    Sonata was created by a team of eight Newcastle University students
                    as a submission for the module found
                    <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/study/module/CSC2022" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Our objective was to create an app to help a user learn something.

                <h1>Is this app available for iOS or Windows devices?</h1>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to time restraints only an Android version was constructed.
                    We do not plan on releasing an alternative port of the application, nor do we
                    intend to update the current version.

                    You can download the app on your Android phone <a href="assets/app.apk">here</a>.
